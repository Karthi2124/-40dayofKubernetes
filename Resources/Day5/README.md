Kubernetes is often called "k8s" or "k-eights", where the 8 stands for the number of letters between the “K” and the “s”. The word "Kubernetes" comes from ancient Greek and means "helmsman" or "pilot". 
Kubernetes was developed by Google engineers in 2014 and is now managed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It's widely adopted by companies of all sizes, including half of the Fortune 100.
